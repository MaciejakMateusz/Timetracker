# Task Manager/Time Tracker

This is a task manager app that allows users to create, manage, 
and track tasks and their operations. It provides an interface 
for creating tasks, adding operations to tasks, updating task 
and operation details, and deleting tasks and operations.

The app utilizes a **RESTful API** provided by the Todo API service. 
It communicates with the API to perform various operations such as:
- retrieving tasks 
- creating tasks and operations 
- updating task and operation details 
- deleting tasks and operations.

## Usage
To use this app, you need to have access to the Todo API service. 
Make sure to set the *apiHost* and *apiKey* variables in ***apiFunctions.js***
file to match your API endpoint and authentication key.

Once the API configuration is set, you can run the app to interact with 
the task manager interface. Please note that this app is for demonstration 
purposes and may require additional error handling and input validation 
to be production-ready.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it to suit your needs. 
Enjoy using my Task Manager App!
